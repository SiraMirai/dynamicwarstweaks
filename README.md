# DeadAir Dynamic Wars

## Scripted events at set intervals that change relations between two AI factions. The stronger a faction is, the more enemies it will likely have. The weaker a faction is, the more friends it will likely have.

## Possible level of relations changes:
## Adjustable weights as of v1.36
- Instant max relations (+30)
- Big boost to relations (+20 at relation 0)
- Small boost to relations (+5 at relation 0)
- Small blow to relations (-5 at relation 0)
- Large blow to relations (-20 at relation 0)
- Instant max negative relations (-30)

## Provides notification and small fictional event that caused.

## Adds several informational menus that display military ship count, economic ship/station count, and a factions ware supply/demand (credit to SirNukes). Adds a diplomacy menu that allows you to purchase relations changes between player faction and AI, or between two AI factions. Occasional free changes are allowed based on how long you have been close allies with a faction.
